Welcome to my **15 Days of HTML and CSS Challenge** repository! ðŸš€ This repository showcases my journey through a 15-day challenge hosted on [Codedamn](https://codedamn.com). The goal of this challenge is to improve my web development skills, focusing on mastering HTML and CSS. Each day, I work on a specific task that allows me to explore various concepts, from basic HTML structure and semantic tags to advanced CSS techniques like Flexbox, Grid, and animations. ðŸŽ¨ Throughout the challenge, I will be building a range of projects, from simple layouts to more complex responsive designs, while continuously refining my skills in web accessibility and responsive design principles. This challenge serves as an excellent opportunity to solidify my knowledge and build a strong foundation in front-end development. ðŸ’» Keep an eye on this repository as I update it daily with new projects and improvements. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome! ðŸ™Œ
